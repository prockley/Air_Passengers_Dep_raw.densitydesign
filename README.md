Air_Passengers_Dep_raw.densitydesign
====================================

This started as a means of looking at d3.js interactive visualisations but while doing this I saw that I needed some practice getting SVG graphics files online.

SVG graphics are vector based and so scale really nicely when people get pinching on the screens of their mobile devices.

### Data Source

The data was downloaded from the website of the CSO. Only data for departing passengers was used as it was thought it would be (almost) a mirror of the arriving passengers (might look at migration another time).

_Data Source_
[TAA02: Passenger, Freight and Commercial Flights by Airports in Ireland, Country, Direction, Flight Type, Year and Statistic](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=TAA02&PLanguage=0)

#### Aggregating Countries

There were too many countries to show on one chart so they were aggregated using the [United Nations Geoscheme].

### Generating SVG graphics

Trying out Raw by Density Design to produce Vector Graphic showing Air Passenger Destinations from Ireland.
